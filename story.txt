One of the first stories to feature time travel by means of a machine is "The Clock that Went Backward" by Edward Page Mitchell,[29] which appeared in the New York Sun in 1881. However, the mechanism borders on fantasy. An unusual clock, when wound, runs backwards and transports people nearby back in time. The author does not explain the origin or properties of the clock.[28]: 55  Enrique Gaspar y Rimbau's El Anacronópete (1887) may have been the first story to feature a vessel engineered to travel through time.[30][31] Andrew Sawyer has commented that the story "does seem to be the first literary description of a time machine noted so far", adding that "Edward Page Mitchell's story The Clock That Went Backward (1881) is usually described as the first time-machine story, but I'm not sure that a clock quite counts".[32] H. G. Wells' The Time Machine (1895) popularized the concept of time travel by mechanical means.[33]
